\begin{abstract}
In total functional (co)programming valid programs are guaranteed to
always produce (part of) their output in a finite number of steps.

Enforcing this property while not sacrificing expressivity has been
challenging, traditionally systems like Agda and Coq have relied on a
syntactic restriction on (co)recursive calls, which is inherently
anti-modular and sometimes leads to unexpected interactions with new
features.

Guarded recursion, first introduced by Nakano, has been recently
applied in the coprogramming case to ensure totality through typing
instead, by capturing through a new modality the relationship between
the consumption and the production of data.

In this paper we show how that approach can be extended to
additionally ensure termination of recursive programs, through the
introduction of a dual modality and the interaction between the
two. As in the coprogramming case, however, we need clock variables to
separate different flows of data. Existential quantification over
clocks then recovers inductive types from guarded ones, dually to how
universal quantification recovers coinductive types.

\section{Introduction}
To get a recursive program to pass the standard termination checkers
of systems like Coq or Agda, the recursive calls must have
structurally smaller arguments. This is the case for the $map$ function on lists.
\begin{verbatim}
map : ∀ {A B : Set} → (A → B) → List A → List B
map f []       = []
map f (x ∷ xs) = f x ∷ map f xs
\end{verbatim}
Here the argument $xs$ is manifestly smaller than $x ∷ xs$ because
it's a direct ``subtree''.

However such a syntactic check gets in the way of code reuse and
compositionality, especially when trying to use higher-order
combinators like in the following example defining a mapping function
for rose trees.

\begin{verbatim}
data RoseTree a = Node (List (RoseTree a))

mapRT : ∀ {A B : Set} → (A → B) → RoseTree A → RoseTree B
mapRT f (Node ts) = map (\ t -> mapRT f t) ts
\end{verbatim}
The definition of mapRT is not accepted because syntactically $t$ has
no relation to $Node ts$, we need to pay attention to the semantics of
$map$ to accept this definition as terminating, in fact a common
workaround is to essentially inline the code for $map$.
\begin{verbatim}
mapRT : ∀ {A B : Set} → (A → B) → RoseTree A → RoseTree B
mapRT f (Node ts) = mapmapRT f ts
  where
    mapmapRT f []       = []
    mapmapRT f (t ∷ ts) = mapRT f t ∷ mapmapRT f ts
\end{verbatim}

Here we have spelled out the nested recursion as a function
$mapmapRT$, and the checker can figure out that $mapRT$ is only going
from the call $mapRT f (Node (t ∷ ts))$ to $mapRT f t$, so it's accepted.

Such a system then actively fights abstraction, and offers little
appeals other than sticking to some specific ``design patterns'' for
(co)recursive definitions. From that comes the temptation to put more
sophisticated heuristics into the checker, which from time to time
need to be retracted.\mytodo{expand on prolem with univalence? at least add citations}

Recently there's been a fair amount of research into moving to the
type level the information about how functions consume and produce
data, so that totality checking is reduced to type-checking
\cite{BobConor} \cite{Rasmus} or close to it \cite{Andreas}, \cite{Foundational Coinduction}.

This paper extends to the case of recursion
the previous work on Guarded Recursion \cite{BobConor} \cite{Rasmus},
which was focused on corecursion and where inductive types were only
given their primitive recursor, by presenting a more relaxed model where
the connectives for guarded recursion can convive with their duals.

We make the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item We define a core type system which supports total programming by
  combining guarded recursion, both existential and universal clock
  quantification and a new delay modality. From these primitives we
  can derive both (finitely branching) initial algebras and final
  coalgebras, i.e. inductive and coinductive datatypes. The type
  system is an extension of Martin Loef Type Theory.
\item We give an interpretation of the system into a relationally
  parametric model of dependent type theory \cite{atkey:param-model},
  drawing a parallel between clock quantification and parametric
  polymorphism.
\item In particular we show how existential types which support
  representation independence can be defined in a predicative system
  by truncating sigma types to the universe of discrete reflexive
  graphs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Guarded Recursion}

The basic principle of Guarded Recusion is to keep track of the
guardedness information in the types. Going back to the rose tree
example we can give the data constructor $Node$ a more precise type.

\begin{verbatim}
Node : (List (\trib RoseTree a)) → RoseTree a
\end{verbatim}

The type constructor $\trib$ makes explicit that the subtrees are
built, and can be consumed, in fewer time/steps than the resulting
tree. \mytodo{is time still a good metaphor? In the end this is all
  about well-founded induction, maybe I should be upfront about that
  from the start.}

Once we've done that we can write $mapRT$ by reusing $map$.
\begin{verbatim}
mapRT : ∀ {A B : Set} → (A → B) → RoseTree A → RoseTree B
mapRT f (Node ts) = map (\ t -> mapRT f t) ts
\end{verbatim}

Here the recursive call stands for an implicit use of a guarded
fixpoint combinator we will introduce later \ref{fix0}, so it gets
type $(A -> B) -> \trib RoseTree A → \trib RoseTree B$, i.e. it can
only handle smaller trees but also produces smaller trees, and the
definition typechecks.

In general we will have to deal with data of unrelated sizes, so we
instead have a family of type constructors $\trib^\kappa$ indexed by
clock variables $\kappa$.

- clock variables to disentangle, existential to forget

%% - Describe Problem
%%    - problem 1: replace syntactic checks
%%            - examples of anti-modularity? 
%%               - rose tree
%%               - div for later
%%            - inconsistencies? with univalence i mean 
%%            - too much stuff? Write it, can be moved.
%%    - problem 2: guarded recursion applied only to corecursion
%%       - coinductive types defined with guards and fixpoints but inductive types as primitive
      
%% - List the contributions
%%   - dualize! (find better name than codelay)
%%   - allows codelay and existential -- why no codelay and pure for delay?
%%   - extension on MLTT with delay and codelay mod, fixpoints on universes, quantifiers over clock variables.
%%   - denotational model based on logical relations/parametricity
%%   - existential quant. as representationally independent one via relational truncation
%%  \ref{termination-univ-Agda} \ref{termination-univ-Coq}

%% \Section{2}
%%   - guarded rose-tree example, don't show fix
%%   - how do you really write introductions for e.g. nil, or zero,  oh actually (A ~ ∃ k, A) when k free in A
%%   - dualize! but 
%%   - why different kind of semantics? (i.e. no CPO), ``i don't like non-termination''
%%   - comparing
%%      - model makes us give up general pure : a -> delay a
%%      - example hard to do with sized types? mostly reasoning, or for coinduction something from the HOL paper
%%                                          also hard to ``forget'' sizes (find example?)
%%                                          - recognizers! Recognizers.agda
%%      - big difference with BobConorRasmus, arrow types are not kripke, cite neelk's frp lang?
%%   - formalized irrelevancy of accessibility proofs(?)
%%   - try to define a universe ala induction-recursion. ala guardedness-preserving, see release notes. 
%%   - apparently we can do nested/mixed recursion, see CatSZ.agda
